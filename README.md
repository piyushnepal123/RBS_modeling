# RBS_modeling
A regenerative braking system model based on a MATLAB script file uses vehicle dynamic equations. An Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) is used as an input. Just run the live script file in MATLAB but a UDDS Excel file is required. The drive cycle file can be swapped to have other simulations
